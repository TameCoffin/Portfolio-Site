                                Hi! I'm Seth! Also known as my online alias, "Tame Coffin!"</p>
                            <p>
                                If you're reading this, it means I completed my time at the Mississippi Coding Academy and now I'm looking for work! I started the program in 2023 and it built me a rock-solid foundation in coding! Coding was always very intimidating to me, but the program helped me gain tons of confidence in my ability to understand it. I know have a Certificate in Fundamentals of Full Stack Web Development. I turned 25 as of November 2023 and it’s crazy to think about! I’m nearly turning 30… oof. They say that your 30s are the best times of your life, but they also said that about your 20s as well. And to be fair, my 20s have been great! I’ve grown so much as a person than from who I was many years ago.</p>
                            <p>
                                Speaking of, about me!:</p>
                            <p>
                                I have always been a creative type. I drew little comics about my imaginary characters ever since I was 4 years old. My mother’s side of the family are also all creatives as well! One of my uncles is even a professional artist! We are also quite similar in that all of us keep to ourselves a good bit to much, hah! Coding is a match made in heaven for me, as one of my biggest drives in life is problem solving. Anything and everything I do; I want to understand and know why it works the way it does. I’m an endlessly curious person and I want to see and learn so much. This curiosity has led me to developing a strong skillset in art, music, animation, writing, and now coding! To be honest, I often overwhelm myself!</p>
                            <p>
                                I’m certainly an introverted person. I spend a lot of time in my own head; debating people that don’t actually exist in order to understand myself more and more. This has been both good and bad for me I’d say. On the positive, I feel very in tune with myself, and I’ve come to understand how and why I function the way I do. It’s been incredibly gratifying to essentially problem solve myself. On the negative, I’m not super social and I don’t go out much. I do fine when I’m out, but I’d much rather be at home working on something, y’know?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But my priority will always be others needs; work especially. If anyone ever needs help, I want to get in on their issues and help resolve them. I don’t fully know of the different avenues in coding development, but if I had a hunch, I’d say that my drive would be in ease of function and accessibility, as well as communication. I was in and out of college for a few years, but I never really clicked. However, when I was in classes, my absolute favorite was design. I LOVE design! Those classes have stuck with me the most and have entirely changed my outlook on the perceived world around me. It’s so so much, but it’s so gratifying to find all these little reasons as to why things are made the way they are. It’s absolutely my bliss.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think I’ve developed such an interest in communication due to me having a lot of trouble speaking my thoughts. I very recently found out that I’m on the spectrum, which was quite shocking at first, but I eventually felt assured by it as it explained so much as to why I’m the way I am. So, a lot of my time I spend trying to communicate my thoughts through my creations as it’s much easier to express myself. Even as of writing this bio, I’m having to pause for about a minute between each sentence to try and find the words that best describe what I’m trying to say.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All of this has given me a deep understanding of those that also struggle to express themselves; and along with my desire to want to help people, my goals are as clear as ever. I want to create innovative art and design that not only excites pros in their field, but also those that feel unseen. The creative world has helped me to understand myself so much and I want others to feel as one with myself as I do because of this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Basically, I may be too ambitious for my own good, hah! Breaking out of my shell and networking has been the hardest for me. I hope I’m able to meet fellow minded people in the future so I can put all this pent-up energy into something that will really help others!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apologies for the info dump! I suppose that’s the whole point of a bio though, haha!
                            </p>
